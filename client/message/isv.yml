      Akrantiain is a system that automatically generates phonetic symbols based on the spelling of words.
      If you set the source code, Akrantiain will automatically generate a phonetic symbol from a spelling and display it next to the spelling.
      If a word has a specified pronunciation, it will be displayed instead.
      For more information on Akrantiain’s syntax, please refer to the <link>documentation</link> (currently only available in Japanese).
    zatlinSource: >-
      Zatlin is a system that generates random spellings of words.
      If you set the source code, a ‘Generate’ button will appear in the word editor, allowing you to generate a spelling by Zatlin.
      For more information on Zatlin’s syntax, please refer to the <link>documentation</link> (currently only available in Japanese).
    enableMarkdown: >-
