      Akrantiain is a system that automatically generates phonetic symbols based on the spelling of words.
      If you set the source code here, Akrantiain will automatically generate a phonetic symbol from a spelling and display it next to the spelling.
      If a word has a specified pronunciation, it will be displayed instead.
      For more information on Akrantiain’s syntax, please refer to the <link>documentation</link> (currently only available in Japanese).
    zatlinSource: >-
      Zatlin is a system that generates random spellings of words.
      If you set the source code here, a ‘Generate’ button will appear in the word editor, allowing you to generate a spelling by Zatlin.
      For more information on Zatlin’s syntax, please refer to the <link>documentation</link> (currently only available in Japanese).
    enableAdvancedWord: >- 
      If you enable this feature, you can register multiple sections in a word, with each section containing a range of information from translations to related words.
    enableMarkdown: >-
      Enabling this feature will allow you to write the contents of words in Markdown format.
    enableDuplicateName: >-
      If you enable this feature, when you enter a spelling in the word editor, it will tell you whether the dictionary already has a word with the same spelling.
      Note that it only checks for spelling duplication and does not prevent you from registering a word with the same spelling.
    punctuations: >-
      These characters are used as delimiters for translation terms.
      The text entered in the translation field is delimited by the characters set here, each of which is registered as a translation term and will be the target of the translation search.
    ignoredEquivalentPattern: >-
      When extracting translation terms from the text entered in the translation field, the parts matching this regexp pattern are ignored.
      The matches therefore will not be included in the translation search.
      This can be used, for example, if you want to show the case structure of a verb in the translation field, but do not want it to be included in the translation search.
    wordCardTitles: >-
